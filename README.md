# ThisLifeOfMine

This game is my main project.

I decided to make only one project to so that I can learn new things like animation and audio design. 
This project also allows me to add new systems and features to the game while also being mindful of what already exists.

From time to time you may find that I have not commited in weeks or months, this could be becuase I am currently researching something, doing some 3D modelling or I could just be completely demotivated and overwhelmed. Again, this is the way I choose to do this. To simulate real world development (for the most part).

This game takes place in a fictional 5th century era, where wars are rare and the history books are mostly blank. 

You play a woman named Keena (24). Daughter to a quartermaster and a tresurer (I haven't decided yet which parent is which yet) and live in a town known for there exquisite woodworking craftmanship. Welcome to Rybridge!

During the madatory training class - that all kids need to do when turning 16 (this is a type of madatory military service) - the lesson was weapon management and stances. After a few attempts at swinging a sword and holding a shield, failing dramtically when doing so, Keena became incredibiliy frustrated at the weight of the hardware and demanded that she drops the weight by training using martial arts instead. Fighting using her fists and feet was something she believed that gave her an advantage and she could not be weighed down by clunky gear. This was heavily rejected and Keena burst into a tantrum, throwing the gear away and attacking the swordsmaster using martial arts to show them how much the gear was limiting her fighting capabilities. This too failed, however, but she displayed an impressive amount of strength. This was the beginning of her training to become the only warrior known in the land that does not wield a weapon - she wants to be the weapon. 

Keena will focus mostly on the speed of the attacks rather than the strength behind them, but that doesn't mean that she is a push over. Keena continued to train by herself for 8 years before finally getting the courage to sign up for the annual, regional warriors tournement - Abasteles√© (this is the name of ruler that first coined this idea). This tournement will consist of 15 challenges that take part at differnet towns and cities where a 'champion'-like person is selected as the challenge. After this, one more challenger needs to be beaten to take the regional champion title. 

Not all is as straight forward as it seems (obviously). Magic is in its infancy and people are trying to master the elements that make up our world, as well as use them in a variety of ways from necromancy to theatre. As the game progresses Keena displays an affinity to the Wind (this is to cement her preference of speed when fighting). Keena is not special in this regard as anyone can display an affinnity to the elements (Wind, Ground, Fire, Water and Death/Darkness - a typical fantasy trope but...shut up). 

I haven't expanded on the main line story but I have notes written down as to where I want it to go, but first things first I need to actually get some work done and make sure I can get the features working and ready.
